Pre-Work 2

Hi, Jacob Shavel reporting live here from the kitchen counter at home, in Lawrenceville, NJ. I flew in yesterday from Shanghai, so didn't sleep much last night at all. My one job today: don't fall asleep. If I can make it through the day (yoga class, running a couple errands, lunch with my grandfather) without a nap, I will be in good shape to shake this jetlag...just in time to go to Cape Town and get messed up on sleep all over again. If strange sleep patterns are the price of adventure, I'm happy to pay the fare.
